The program will ask which eye is weaker. Once answered it will set an algorithm towards the weaker side and set up an interval time with targets. 

Controls – Point and slap the targets. Trigger button is going to be on your index finger select option. 

BLUE SQUARE – HIT
LAVA SPHERE – DO NOT HIT (Health/Life Deduction if hit)
LIFE-POINTS - TEN

It is best to not hit the blue squares if they are jumbled alongside with the Lava Balls. It is okay to ignore them as you will not be penalized for not hitting targets but only hitting the Lava Balls. 

Fifty-Points accumulated; you win the game.
